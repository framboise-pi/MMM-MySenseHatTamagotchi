  * activities will be available depending on age
  * LED display : slides between tamagotchi and rooms/activities and messages
  * on MagicMirror : health, age, name, moral, etc. -- messages -- icons animations
  * tamagotchi will grow (... it is a ... raspberry !)
  * sickness based on temperature, anger,...
  * can die (2 weeks with no food, 3 weeks with no cleaning,...)
  ...
  
 # How ?
 * interact with SenseHat joystick
 * interact with microphone
 * interact by handling SenseHat and moving it,...

 it misses the 3 different ages (babe, young, adult) | the birth/death sequence | cleaning the loft | games | sensors things |
